# Session 4: Practical Workflow 🔄

## **Steps** 🛠️

1. **Bootstrap:**
   - Run `cdk bootstrap` to initialize the environment for CDK. 🚀
   - This step sets up the necessary resources in your AWS account, such as an S3 bucket for storing deployment artifacts. 📦

   **Command:**

   ```bash
   cdk bootstrap
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure dependencies are installed and up-to-date by running `npm install`. 🔄
   - This step ensures that your project has all the required libraries and modules. 📚

   **Command:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   - Provision resources to AWS using `cdk deploy`. 🏗️
   - This step deploys your stack to AWS and creates the resources defined in your CDK code. 🌟

   **Command:**

   ```bash
   cdk deploy
   ```

4. **Diff:**
   - Compare local changes with deployed resources using `cdk diff`. 🔍
   - This step helps you understand what changes will be made before deploying. 🛠️

   **Command:**

   ```bash
   cdk diff
   ```

5. **Verify:**
   - Validate changes without executing them using `cdk synth`. ✅
   - This step generates the CloudFormation template and lets you review it. 📜

   **Command:**

   ```bash
   cdk synth
   ```
